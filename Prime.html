						Amazon Prime Lounge </h4> 
						<p>The final design was an evolution of real world
						testing. It allows people to enjoy watching and talking about movies together, wherever they are. It does this by allowing people to co-watch anything on Amazon Prime and creates group conversations for everyone involved.

				<h4>Brief</h4>
				<div class="coretext">
					<p>Our brief was to improve the social aspect 
					of Amazon Prime Instant Video. The aim 
					was to recall the shared social experience 
					of TV in the past to the social media 
					heavy instant video accessible future.</p>
				</div>


				<h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<img src="images/competitive.jpg" alt="Competitive Analysis" />
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>
						We saw that there were many streaming services but very few 
						had achieved social success however sites such as Twitch streaming gaming live had managed
						this with 45million users and is one of the few services promoting watching
						content with people live this seemed key to their success.</p>	
					</div>
				</div>

				<h4>Surveys</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<img src="images/survey.jpg" alt="Survey" />
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>
						Our Typeform survey informed us people watch in a variety of ways but prefered to
						use larger desktop screens or TVs for viewing and mobile for talking about what they watched.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
					
				<h4>User Interviews</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<img src="images/interview.jpg" alt="Interview" />
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>We interviewed a number 
						of users to gain qualitative
						information and they showed some key patterns, importantly for us that most of them 
						loved to share their viewing experiences and that this was most commonly done soon after or sometimes
						during watching. </p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h4>Personas &amp; Scenarios</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<img src="images/personas.jpg" alt="Personas" /> 
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>	
						We created personas and for them scenarios to help 
						better understand our users and their situations. 
						This informed us currently trying to sync viewing times with
						friends is a difficult experience when streaming.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
						
				<h4>Features</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<img src="images/features.jpg" alt="Features" />
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>	
						Two main features were chosen. To be able to set up films that could be watched
						at a scheduled time on everyones devices (co-watching) and a chatroom running during and after
						for groups to share their experiences. We called this sycned feature "Prime Lounge" to echo the shared living room
						experience of the past.</p>
					</div>

				<h4>Sketching</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<img src="images/sketching.jpg" alt="Sketching" />
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>
						We conducted a design
						studio session initially
						to rapidly brainstorm
						different design solutions
						which we then developed
						into our chosen solution.</p>

				<h4 class="fidelitytitle">Wireframe Fidelity</h4>
				<p class="boxfidelity">
				Wireframes were made in increasing fidelity as

						<p>
						To prepare for testing and provide a

				<h4>User Testing</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<img src="images/usertesting.jpg" alt="Usertesting" />
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>
						Testing was conducted at a local cinema lounge to help capture our target audience
						for relevant testing. They found the app easy to use with just a few tweeks needed
						and told us they loved the idea and would even have liked it for personal videos as well as
						mainstream film and TV content.
