				<h4>Designing my Website Portfolio</h4>
				<div class="coretext">
					<p>I coded this website from the ground up using with html and css. It was important to me to gain an understanding of all the elements that contribute to building a web page. This ment designing the concept, converting design into code and creating the visual elements myself including creating the images and designing the background. </p>
				</div>
			</div>

				<h4>A Site That Represents Me</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<img src="images/mood.jpg" alt="Sketching" />
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>
						I wanted this site to reflect my design style and so for influence I created a style board of various images that help summarise my style. This board as shown is calm and gives images space to stand out. Clear but soft colours, textures and gradients help to draw emphasis to elements within.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h4>Layout</h4>
				<div class="info narrow">
					<img src="images/sitewire.jpg" alt="Sketching" />
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>
						I started the design process with wireframes made in Omnigraffle to gain an idea of how the site would be set out. This does not represent the final product but provided a starting point.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h4>Mockups</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<img src="images/mockups.jpg" alt="Sketching" />
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>
						Once the wireframes were complete I moved to constructing mockups in Affinity Designer. I continualy altered these based on feedback.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h4>Coding</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<img src="images/code.jpg" alt="Sketching" />
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>
						I started to build what I had mocked up in code. This gave me a more realistic view of how the site would look and allowed me to better demonstrate it for feedback.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h4 class="space">Feedback</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<div class="coretext less">
						<p>
						On getting valuable feedback from several people it appeared that although I had built a site representative of my style the layout was not fluid and images of my work needed to be more prominent. This lead to some major alterations of the design and ultimately lead to the design you see now.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h4>The Background</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<img id="examplebackground" src="images/background5.jpg" alt="background design">
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>
						As a fresh start for the new design I started with the background. Instead of using colours or adjusting images, I decided to design it myself to better achieve my style. I designed it using pixelmator, aiming to make it look like brushed metal to bring back textures I had earlier found influential and provide a background that images would stand out on.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h4 class="space">Final Design Descisions</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>
						For the new design I made text and images more centralised for easier reading and increase font size and spacing to make it more legible. I added a light blue colour scheme to help tie the site together, reinforced by the colour of the background label I designed to the bottom right. Check out my other case studies and I hope you enjoy using the site as much as I have enjoyed creating it.</p>
