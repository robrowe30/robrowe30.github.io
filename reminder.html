						Reminder App </h4> 
						<p>This was my first project at General Assembly conducted over 1 week. The outcome was an app that would encourage users to get to their destinations on time by tracking the time they lost or gained when early or late and recording a running total.

				<h4>Brief</h4>
				<div class="coretext">
					<p>My brief was to understand a chosen problem for a fellow student and develop an app that could help combat this. My users problem was being late. He informed me he had tried, alarms, reminder apps and notepads but all were too easy to dismiss. He wanted an app that could help get him to places on time. This information was retrived during an informal interview over 25 minutes.</p>
				</div>

				<h4>User Flows</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<img src="images/timeflow.jpg" alt="User Flow" />
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>
						I created flows for setting a standard reminder app following apples reminder app through its steps. This showed me there were many steps for setting a very simple function that only delivered an alarm and helped explain my user quickly abandoning this as an effective reminder solution.</p>
					</div>
				</div>


				<h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<img src="images/nikeplus.jpg" alt="Nike Plus" />
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>
						I looked at what several other companies had attempted including watch solutions and apples reminder app. However these mostly shared my users problem of being easy to dismiss.I widened my research to include apps that help users achieve goals. This included apps such as Nike Plus, encouraging users by tracking progress and proved very successful.</p>	
					</div>
				</div>
					
				<h4>The Idea</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>I had discoverd that traditional methods had proved unsuccessful being too easy to dismiss. Research had showen me that using an incentive instead of an alarm such as Nike plus, may prove more effective. I knew phones can track location so could determine how early or late a person arrived at their destination. If a phone could carry this out and record it, the time a person gained or lost by being late could be the incentive.  </p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h4>Primary Sketches</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<img src="images/timesketches.jpg" alt="Sketches" /> 
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>	
						I carried out some primary sketching to quickly gain an idea of how such an app could work. This was influenced by the earlier user flow and shown to the user as well. His feedback helped inform UI descisions in further sketching helping to refine the solution.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
						
				<h4>User Testing</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>	
						A new set of sketches were loaded into Marvel App on my phone in the form of a clickable prototype. This was then given to my user to see how he interacted with it. Watching him use the app gave a far clearer view of how the flow would work and helped make the interface more fluent.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
					
				<h4>Final Design</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>
						The final design allowed users to enter a location and time and would show on graphs how much time the user had lost or gained over a week. The app could also show already set locations and allow targets to be set. The progress graph replaced interface buttons on the home screen with the user feedback signalling for the easiest way possible to view progress as this was the important area of the app.</p>
