						The Magic Toy Shop </h4> 
						<p>This project was to design an e-commerce website for The Magic Toy Shop. A store selling retro and new toys looking to be the big brand with the little store feel. The Final solution was a site that used large images of the toys spread across the whole width of the page with simple navigation at the top and a fun sense of branding.

				<h4>Brief</h4>
				<div class="coretext">
					<p>The project was to design a e-commerce website proposal for a brand called The Magic Toy Shop. The site had to be both intuitive for its users and clearly present the companies brand values. The Magic Toy Shop was a brand that sold both new and retro toys and wanted to show it valued its unique catalog of offerings coming across like a small boutique while selling a large number of  products, the big brand with the little store feel.</p>
				</div>

				<h4>Personas</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<img src="images/toypersona.jpg" alt="User Flow" />
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>
						We were provided with three personas for this project; John - The dad looking for quality products to meet his daughters ever changing interests, Tamsin - After magic gifts for her grandson and an easy stress free experience and Dexter - The tech savy collector after the next quality product he can proudly show off.  Full versions of these personas were used to make sure design decisions made reflected the people that would use the site.</p>
					</div>
				</div>


				<h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<img src="images/toycompetitors.jpg" alt="Competative Analysis" />
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>
						It was important to both see how other Toy companies worked to see where the Magic Toy Shop fitted in. Big toy brands such as Toys R Us were looked at and had websites that appeared cluttered and overwhelming but offered everything. Boutiques such as Kid Robot showed us a cleaner sites with more emphasis on product quality but often felt limited. Also other e-commerce sites such as John Lewisâ€™s toy section showed us very usable interfaces for large product ranges but more bland branding global to the whole site. We felt our brand required the usability of John Lewis with the approachable feel of the boutique stores.</p>

				</div>
					
				<h4>Card Sorting</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<img src="images/toycardsort.jpg" alt="Card Sorting" />
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>The Magic Toy shop had a wide variety of different product and to understand how to put these into the most effective categories I carried out a number of card sorts, firstly with physical cards and then online letting a larger number of people sort through products watching what categories people thought most appropriate for products. This was important as I wanted to avoid the confusion of stores such as The Entertainer and Toys R Us.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h4>User Flows and Site Map</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<img src="images/toyflow.jpg" alt="User FLow" />
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>	
						In addition to card sorting to ensure the sites navigation was fluid I created user flows for both finding and purchasing products on an e-commerce site. This helped me to see the process required for The Magic Toy shop.In addition I created a site map to start to provide structure to decisions made during the card sort and from the user flows.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
						
				<h4>Sketching</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<img src="images/toysketch.jpg" alt="Sketching" />
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>	
						Design for the sites interface started with sketching to quickly develop a range of ideas that could be narrowed down. Based on research the design emphasis was to allow for large pictures of the toys uncluttered by unnecessary information while at the same time providing a navigation format that allowed users to easily find desired products.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h4>Wireframes</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<img src="images/toywire.jpg" alt="Wireframe" />
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>	
						Once a design had been narrowed down I increased the fidelity creating more realistic wireframes using Omnigraffle. This also made it easier to make designs across different pages more uniform and gave a better understanding of the scale of content required for a web page.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h4>User Testing</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>	
						Once wireframes had reached an appropriate fidelity, pages for specific user flows were loaded into Marvel App as a clickable prototype. This meant I could then sit down with various users to test the website in a more realistic fashion. This lead to alterations to navigation and some of the language used in the checkout process particularly.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
					
				<h4>Final Design</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>
						The final gives priority to large images letting customers clearly see exactly what they are getting. This also allows for faster browsing with users quickly identifying products. The feel of the site is inviting only displaying important information and using friendly language to help users enjoy the brand, a key requirement of the brief and personas. </p>
