						Radio Times </h4> 
						<p>Our task was to improve the Radio Times online onboarding process. The final solution placed timely advertisements for sign up of membership and the initial screen now clearly demonstrates the benefits of being a member. The sign up process itself has become a gameified process allowing users to quickly rate shows to add them to the Radio Times Watchlist.

				<h4>Brief</h4>
				<div class="coretext">
					<p>Our brief was to improve the onboarding process for the Radio Times online site looking to improve the conversion rate of the high number of site users to full members.</p>
				</div>


				<h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<img src="images/rtcompetitor.jpg" alt="Competitive Analysis" />
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>
						We looked at both direct competitors such as tv guide and competitors with successful onboarding processes. Sites such as Quartze doubled sign up by simplifying the process and we saw sites like Beamly and Rdio giving clear demonstrations of the benefits of membership before and during sign up. </p>	
					</div>
				</div>

				<h4>The Users</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<img src="images/rtusers.jpg" alt="Radio Times Users" />
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>
						The Radio Times provided us with information suggesting their two key demographics were users 25-40yrs who visited the site for news and those 45+ who came primarily for TV listings. Our own survey unearthed that there was also a large number of the younger demographic that valued listings.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
					
				<h4>User Interviews</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<img id="interview" src="images/ven.svg" alt="Interview" />
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>We hand picked both Radio Times users and online news and listings users and conducted 15 interviews. We found that there were many common traits between the key demographics including the want to know when content is available/airing and interestingly that a need had developed with many people using notebooks, emails and other methods to remind them when shows were on.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h4>Personas</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<div id="amy">
						<img id="persona" src="images/rtamy.svg" alt="Personas" />
						<img id="about" src="images/rtaboutamy.svg" alt="Personas" /> 
					</div>
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>	
						We created three personas. The first two, David and Sarah respectively represented the two key demographics, the third, Amy represented someone with many of the common needs and pain points shared by these demographics and became influential to many descisions from this point onwards.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
						
				<h4>Features</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>	
						There were two main ideas we concentrated on developing. Firstly that sign up was currently boring with lots of checkboxes and this needed to improve, we looked towards a gamefied approach having found this successfuly for others in research. Additionally we new there was a calling for program storage and reminders and the Radio Times already had a watchlist feature that could serve this but we needed to make this more explicit in sign up as many users weren't even aware of it during interviews.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			
				<h4>Sketching</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<img src="images/rtsketches.jpg" alt="Sketching" />
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>
						We started by conducting a design studio with our client rapidly generating ideas then continued by ourselves, refining this. A form of liking and disliking programs to add them to the watchlist appeared popular during this process. This generated into a quick optional game called love or loathe that appeared at sign up to help people start adding shows.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
					
				
					
				<h4>Paper Prototype</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<img src="images/rtusertest1.jpg" alt="Sketching" />
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>
						A paper prototype was constructed and user tested so influence from users was drawn at an early stage and allowed us to iterate from an early point.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<h4>Further User Testing</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<img src="images/rtusertest.jpg" alt="Sketching" />
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>
						Two rounds of further testing with clickable prototypes made in invision was conducted to make sure we understood the users needs clearly and iterated our design accordingly. The final testing was carried our at the Radio Times head office with employees for tailored feedback.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<h4>Iterations</h4>
				<div class="info">
					<img src="images/rtiteration.jpg" alt="Sketching" />
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>
						In total we constructed 4 iterations and conducted 3 rounds of user testings. Over the course we upped the fidelity and improved our concept based on feedback. We learned things like users didn't understand the watchlist as it wasn't explained untill they reached it after sign up so we added an interactive demo to both show the users what they get and sell the benefits of sign up. During this process we had many similar findings and improvements to create a better product influenced heavily by users.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
									
				<div class="info">	
				<h4 class="fidelitytitle">Final Design</h4>
					<div class="coretext">
						<p>
						The final design clearly shows the user what they would get at sign up, allowing them to quickly generate content to the watchlist throught the love and loathe game and outlining how to use the watchlist when it is reached. By selling membership benefits upfront and making the onboarding more engadging we belive the sign up conversion rate will rise.</p>
